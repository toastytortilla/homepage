# homepage

This website was made to satisfy the requirements of pset8 in CS50's curriculum. The goal was to get used to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by making a personal website. In the next lesson, we learned how to build web apps with Flask, and I thought it would be a good way to practice the concepts taught by converting the previous assignment into a web app. Since then, it's become my de facto experiment, as well as my general homepage.
